     <p><em>The Incredible Journey</em> is a collaboration between the ss Great Britain Trust and the University of West England. The film was divided up into three parts, with a different discipline responsible for each film.</p>
     <p>Our team's (Motion Graphics) was <em>Part 2: The Journey</em>. I was working with my motion friends <a href="http://www.oliversin.com/" target="_blank">Oliver Sin</a>, <a href="http://www.scott-travers.co.uk/" target="_blank">Scott Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.shoregraphics.co.uk/" target="_blank">Mike Shore</a>. I worked in the capacity of a core After Effects animator.</p>
     <p>I was interviewed by BBC News for this, got kind of nervous, and rambled on about how I made a rope sway in the water. I didn't make the cut.</p>
