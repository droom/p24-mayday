            <p><a href="http://www.dancingbee.net/" target="_blank">Dancing Bee</a> is a digital design studio based in Clapham, London. It's founded and run by Brazillian media 
               guru Fernando Farrah, who's as affable as he is knowledgeable. I learnt so much here, not just about design. It remains the best place I've ever worked.</p>
               
               <p>When he's not pixel pushing, Fer moonlights as an ace chef. I challenge you to <a href="http://www.cucabrazuca.com/" target="_blank">check out his recipies</a>
