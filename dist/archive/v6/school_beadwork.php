            <p>Motion Pathway in the 2nd year was the most enjoyable part of my BA. We were a small, closely-knit bunch and it was like being back at Primary school. </p>
            <p>The final assignement was to produce a sting lasting 90 seconds or less for a randomly chosen publication. Picking the titles out of hat, I drew <em><a href="http://www.interweave.com/bead/beadwork_magazine/default.asp" target="_blank">BeadWork</a></em> magazine by Interveave Press.</p>

        <p>Join these beads on thier cosmic journey through a dusky summer's evening.</p>
        <p>I'm pleased to say the finished product came out exactly as I had initially imagined and it's the piece of work I'm most proud of.</p>

        <p>To add more depth to the beads, I created a texture in Illustrator and overlayed them onto the particles. This is most noticable in the hero shot @0.35. As the scenes got more complex, my trusty MacBook started to choke  on every render. I scraped together the remnants of my student loan and built a PC loaded with DDR3 RAM. This meant I could export on the PC whilst working on another scene on the Mac. Who would have thought those years spent being an introverted teenager would pay off so well?</p>
