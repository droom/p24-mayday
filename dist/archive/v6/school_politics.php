    <p><em>The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil</em> by George Saunders is a critique of humanity. Saunders explores a number of themes in this book, including prejudice 
     (and the beneficiaries of it), blindly following the status-quo, and how we are conditioned to think by powerful institutions. Saunders tone is sometimes optimistic of us 
     as creatures, however the book does end on quite a fatalistic note (implying things will never change).

     <span class="quoteOpen">“</span>Emotive language is often more effective in garnering trust and motivating than simply stating the facts. Phil appeals to the egos of his subordinates and they respond to this in kind. All political speakers I’ve seen do this in some way. Of course, Phil’s motivations, as with most politicians, were self-aggrandising.”</span>
