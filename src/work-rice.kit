            <h2 itemprop="description">An editorial theme for tumblr</h2>
            <p> In 2010 I was looking for a sober, type-led blogging theme to start jotting down design realted musings as they occured to me. I’m not skilled at writing and my ideas are few and far between, but as @<a href="https://twitter.com/RellyAB" class="inline">RellyAB</a> once said, 
               <q>To become a good writer, you need to do a lot of shitty writing first.</q><a href="#ref" class="plain glide-slow"><sup></sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>By using the tumblr platform, the predicted paucity of updates could at least be mitigated with ‘re-blogging’ the content of others. It also had the benefit of being separate from my portfolio in case it was complete garbage.</p>
            <p> There were (and still are) a wealth of themes to choose from, but I couldn’t find precisely what I was looking for. Either the type choices didn't jive with me, it had artefacts or detailing I found superfluous, or it was just too gimmicky. (On reflection, this whole exercise might have just have been a subconscious avoidance strategy to keep me from doing what I feared&hellip; ). So began my first forary into desiging for CMSes and ‘<a href="https://adactio.com/articles/4938" class="inline">the known unknowns</a>.’<a href="#ref" class="plain glide-slow"><sup></sup></a>
            </p>
            <h3>Georgia &plus;&plus;</h3>
            <p> The most important component to get right was the typeface. At this point I was already a huge fan of Georgia; Its ubiquity is a testament to how well it performs, but I think it also prevents us from fully seeing its beauty. During the build, Webtype had released Georgia Pro<a href="#ref" class="plain glide-slow"><sup></sup></a>, an updated version of the Matthew Carter classic with new weights and extra hinting. Side-by-side, the new  letters looked even better.
            </p>

               <figure>
                  <img src="img/projects/fo/fo-georgia.svg" class="max">
                  <figcaption>After sampling quite a few webfonts, I settled on Georgia Pro. Its generous x-height means it performs well at the small sizes (copyright, captions, etc). Amongst the new cuts was even a small caps.</figcaption>

            </div>
            <h3>RWD FTW </h3>
            <p> Sometime in mid-2012 the words ‘responsive’ and ‘design’ comprised about 65% of my twitterfeed, but it was only when Front-Ender/UX Designer/pal @<a href="https://twitter.com/steveavery" class="inline">SteveAvery</a> sent a working demo<a href="#ref" class="plain glide-slow"><sup></sup></a> around the office that the penny dropped for me.
            </p>
            <p>Responsive design was such a huge revelation that might have actually rewired my brain, much in the same way CSS did a decade earlier. The mental model I used to design for screens had now been forever changed.</p>
            <div class="segment align-c blueprint pad squash">
               <figure>
                  <img src="img/projects/fo/fo-reflow.gif" class="max faint">
                  <figcaption>A single post is divided up into three subdivions: date, content and tags. On a wide desktop, date and tags site at opposite sides of the screen. On a smaller table, they stack on top of each other on the left hand side. I had used regular floats to move these sections about. </figcaption>
               </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="segment surface align-c">
               <ul class="swatch fo">
                  <li class="colour"><span class="hex">154B0D</span></li>
                  <li class="colour"><span class="hex">C14D4D</span></li>
                  <li class="colour"><span class="hex">FFFFFF</span></li>
               </ul>
            </div>

            </div>
            <p>Revisiting the source for this 4 years later makes me appreciate (even more) how useful all the build tools we now have are. Back then, I was writing vanilla CSS, manually typing out vendor-prefixes, meticulously indenting and then minifying with some online service. Ridiculous. But at least it kept me from writing.</p>
