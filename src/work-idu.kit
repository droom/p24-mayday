            <h2>Brand creation for a bespoke digital upskilling programme &mdash; a response to job losses and precarity due to the pandemic.</h2>
            <p>
               The summer of 2020 was an interesting time to be alive. As we contented with our own mortality, we were also thinking about what distributed teams meant for the future of work. Outlandish had approached us (Good Praxis) to collaborate on both branding and delivering the course. Islington, in partnership with local tech co-op Outlandish, is delivering bespoke digital skills training to islington residents over 19. This is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to change their career or just become more confident using digital tools and programs
            </p>
            <h3>A note on trends</h3>
            <p>One of the many reasons I find Graphic Design so rewarding is because it's always moving. All graphic communication is in conversation with what's around, and what's come before. It's a good idea to keep an eye on trends—not to emulate (although that's no bad thing early on in one's career)—but to get a read on cultural zeitgeists. Opportunity for visual wit is lower in importance when creating this type of work. We felt we could get away with green on white legibility as they were not crucial to understanding what this poster is trying to tell viewers. This was also a good chance to push our company typeface a bit further (Calibre has great capitals).</p>
            <p>We wanted to create something completely different to usual council comms, yet still fulfil its function as public service design. We felt we could get away with green on white legibility as they were not crucial to understanding what this poster is trying to tell viewers. Type This was also a good chance to push our company typeface a bit further (Calibre has great capitals).</p>
            <p>Along with Caitlin, Polly, and Maddy, I provided remote 1-2-1 guidance on personal + business projects.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">I was always curious about Photoshop but I never had the chance to learn how to use it. Moreover, I didn't think it was possible to learn it online! Chris has been a really good tutor for my learning: clear, patient, expert! Among other online courses experienced during the pandemic, I have to say that this was the only one with a value not only for my creative enjoyment but also for my job profile.<cite class="cite">Manuela Terranova, Islington Council digital upskilling participant</cite></blockquote>
            <p>After surveying participants, we found we had lots of participants say they got in touch because social media posts caught their eye. The course name ‘Tech-ish’ was not important to those joining the course.</p>
            <p>The course was oversubscribed and the council planned to introduce this to other boroughs.</p>
